# ðŸš€ About Me
My name is Anthony Finn, and I'm currently a junior at California State University, San Marcos. The first programming language that I learned was Lua in middle school. I started because I fell in love with creating video games. It was difficult learning to code when I first began. I often had to look at online resources and read the source code of other's programs to begin to understand the basics. I was able to create some very simple games in Lua. They were not that great, but I kept on learning.

Learning how to create video games when I was younger helped me find my passion of solve problems, especially using computers. I love the idea that I can create nearly anything with computers. I am always looking to learning more and gain experience in computer science.
